                    <h3>Personal goal</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the duration of my interaction design class I became very ill. On some days, I could barely sit through class, however, my super awesome peers supported me during that time.</p>
                    <p>I felt I let myself down as the final project was not to my personal standard. Unfortunately, by this time, I was starting to feel somewhat better, but it was too late.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, my instructor encouraged everyone to keep working on our projects even though class was over.</p>
                    <p>The project could have gotten me a subpar recommendation, but that didn’t interest me, at all. Rather, I took my instructor’s advice and continued working on my project, but under 2 conditions.</p>
                    <p>The first condition being presenting my project in front of other industry leaders. The second condition was receiving a thoughtful letter of recommendation, one that was truly earned.</p>
                    <p>I presented, got the recommendation, and it felt great.</p>

                    <h4>Concerns</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Figma</li>
                        <li>Photoshop</li>
                        <li>Pen</li>
                        <li>Paper</li>
                        <li>Sticky notes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Pain points</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>COVID-19 protocols</li><li>Feel less depressed</li><li>Experience a secure log-in</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <p>To start, I created a preliminary mind-map just to get my initial thoughts down on paper. Building off my original work in class, I continued heavily researching my audience. </p>
                    <p>In addition, I studied competitor food delivery apps to understand how DoorDash differentiates themselves. From there I also created DoorDash's business offerings to help me understand exactly their main products and primary services. </p>
                    <p>After that, I developed an affinity map, conducted a Heuristic evaluation, & studied DoorDash's Google app Play Store reviews. </p>
                    <p>Eventually, I researched the importance of successful on-boarding, navigation, informative push notifications, and the impacts of COVID-19. </p>
                    <p>When the research side of my project was completed, I went on to create 3 problem statements, users flows, wireframes, and a refined high fidelity prototype. </p>
                    <h4>Next steps</h4>
                    <p>If I were to proceed with my project, the next steps would be to: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conduct session recordings with customers</li>
                        <li>Meet with stakeholders & investors</li>
                        <li>Create SMART goals</li>
                        <li>Revise the initial ideas and come up with new ones with the design team</li>
                        <li>Build out the new ideas</li>
                        <li>Conduct A/B testing</li>
                        <li>Implement a feedback feature</li>
                        <li>Lastly, further refines ideas</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What I learned</h4>
                    <p>I learned that focusing on one, instead of three, problem statements will be key for a successful case study. I also learned that not pushing myself to the point of exhaustion is key, which I almost did, again. </p>
