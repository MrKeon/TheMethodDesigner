                    <h3>Objective & final deliverables (solo project) </h3>
                    <p>Take a picture of an object that I use on a day-to-day basis. After that, take that photo and turn it into a graphic design piece.</p>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Photoshop</li>
                        <li>Illustrator</li>
                        <li>Cellphone camera</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>While working on this project, I re-taught myself the Adobe Suite in four days. The last time I used the Suite was over eight years ago, so it was quite exciting trying to recall everything that I was taught.</p>
                    <h3>Personal goal</h3>
                    <p>I took the photograph and transformed it into something completely new. From mysterious and ethereal to something bold and commanding.</p>
